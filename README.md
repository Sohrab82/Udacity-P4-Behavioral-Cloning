### The Project
---

#### Goals
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. 

#### Files
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track)


#### Dependencies

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
